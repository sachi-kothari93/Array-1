# Problem 3
# Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

# Example 1:

# Input:

# [

# [ 1, 2, 3 ],

# [ 4, 5, 6 ],

# [ 7, 8, 9 ]

# ]
# Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
# Example 2:

# Input:

# [

# [1, 2, 3, 4],

# [5, 6, 7, 8],

# [9,10,11,12]

# ]
# Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]


# TC : O(m√ón)
    # where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. 
    # We visit each element in the matrix exactly once.

# SC : O(1) excluding the result array.
    # We only use a constant amount of extra space for the boundary variables.

# Approach:
# This solution uses a "layer-by-layer" approach where we traverse the matrix 
# in a spiral pattern by defining and shrinking the boundaries of each layer. 
# We process the outer layer first (top row, rightmost column, bottom row, leftmost column), then move inward by shrinking the boundaries.

# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : YES
